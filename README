This README contains instructions on how to download and build MPICH CH4 over OFI Libfabric on Blue Gene /Q.  The following instuctions are tailored for Release 0.2 for now.  Please note that the V1R2M4 driver is required.  There are three github repositories with the relevant code.  The first of these is this github which is the build environment itself.
mkdir <build_env_root_dir>
cd  <build_env_root_dir>
git clone https://github.com/pkcoff/OFI-BGQ-BuildEnv.git

Then checkout the 'Release-0.2' branch:

cd OFI-BGQ-BuildEnv
git checkout Release-0.2

Then clone the ofiwg libfabric github repo master branch into this environment:

cd ofi
git clone https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric.git

Then clone the pmodels mpich github repo into this environment:

cd ../mpi
git clone https://github.com/pmodels/mpich.git

Then create a link from the mpich directory into libfabric to support the libfabric embedded build within mpich:
cd mpich/src/mpid/ch4/netmod/ofi &&   ln -s `cd ../../../../../../../ofi/libfabric && pwd` 

Then run autoconf as follows:
cd <build_env_root_dir>/OFI-BGQ-BuildEnv
./autogen.sh --with-autotools=/soft/buildtools/autotools/feb2015/bin   ---> add the --with-autotools in the Argonne machines due to downlevel autoconf default
./configure
cd ofi/libfabric
./autogen.sh --with-autotools=/soft/buildtools/autotools/feb2015/bin
cd ../../mpi/mpich
./autogen.sh --with-autotools=/soft/buildtools/autotools/feb2015/bin
cd ..
vi simple_configure
  --- change : ${INSTALL_DIR:= to the install dir you want

SPECIAL NOTE FOR BUILDING ON MIRA:
Mira is currently still at V1R2M2 and has not yet moved to V1R2M4.  As a workaround for now,
the V1R2M4 system files have been made available in /soft/libraries/unsupported/V1R2M4-sys.
To utilize them, you'll need to change the following 2 files:

config.site: change this:

MPICHLIB_CPPFLAGS="-I/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/spi/include/kernel/cnk -I/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor"

to this:

MPICHLIB_CPPFLAGS="-I/soft/libraries/unsupported/V1R2M4-sys/spi/include/kernel/cnk -I/soft/libraries/unsupported/V1R2M4-sys"

ofi/libfabric/prov/bgq/configure.m4: change this:

bgq_driver=/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor

to this:

bgq_driver=/soft/libraries/unsupported/V1R2M4-sys
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the 0.2 release both manual and auto progress modes are working.  The default is manual which means all progress is driven manually by mpich, auto progress spawns an ofi pthread that makes progress without depending on mpich.  To build with auto progress change this in the simple_configure:

--with-bgq-progress=manual

to this:

--with-bgq-progress=auto

For the 0.2 release both the basic and scalable mr modes are supported.  The default is now basic
as it allows for MPI_Put hardware accleration.  To build in scalable mode change this in the simple_configure:

--with-bgq-mr=basic

to this:

--with-bgq-mr=scalable

then for gnu 4.7.2 build:
cd <build_directory>
DEBUG build:
CONFIG_TOOLCHAIN=gnu4.7  CONFIG_FLAVOR=debug <build_env_root_dir>/ofi-bgq/mpi/simple_configure
OPT build:
CONFIG_TOOLCHAIN=gnu4.7  CONFIG_FLAVOR=optimized <build_env_root_dir>/ofi-bgq/mpi/simple_configure

then:
make -j16 install

Look in <build_env_root_dir>/config.site for details on compilers and options.

POTENTIAL GCC COMPILE FAILURE NOTE: If you see a failure like this:

<root dir>/OFI-BGQ-BuildEnv/mpi/mpich/src/mpid/ch4/netmod/ofi/libfabric/prov/bgq/src/fi_bgq_init.c:337:1: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before '{' token

It is happening because -I. is not the first include to the gcc compiler in your include path and an incorrect header file is being found and a macro is not being processed correctly.  This is probably due to a configuration setting in your shell and how gcc creates the include path.  If your shell is setting C_INCLUDE_PATH comment that out and it should resolve the issue.
